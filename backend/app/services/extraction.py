"""Invoice field extraction via Claude vision.

Pipeline:
  1. Mark invoice EXTRACTING.
  2. Download PDF from R2.
  3. Render first N pages to PNGs (cap at 4 for cost control).
  4. Call Claude messages API with vision + extraction prompt.
  5. Parse JSON, validate with ExtractedFields.
  6. Fuzzy-match vendor name to an existing Vendor row (case-insensitive).
  7. Persist, set status READY_FOR_REVIEW.
  8. On any failure: set EXTRACTION_FAILED with error message, audit.
