"""Post an approved invoice to QuickBooks Online as a Bill, with PDF attached.

Flow:
  1. Load invoice + vendor + (optional) project
  2. Build the Bill payload using extracted line items
  3. POST /v3/company/{realm}/bill
  4. Upload the PDF as an Attachable linked to the Bill
  5. Persist qbo_bill_id, qbo_posted_at, status=POSTED_TO_QBO
  6. On failure at any stage: keep status=APPROVED, persist qbo_post_error,
     audit the failure. UI shows a "Retry post to QBO" button.

Idempotency: if qbo_bill_id is already set, we skip creating a new Bill and
just ensure the attachment exists (attachment re-upload is OK; QBO allows it).
